## 🚨 Critical Issues to Fix

### Current Problems (Based on User Report):
1. **Fake Data**: ❌ Dashboard shows hardcoded numbers instead of real API data

2. 🔥 **Real Data Integration** - Replace all hardcoded data with API responses
3. 🔥 **Form Functionality** - Ensure auction/lot creation actually works
