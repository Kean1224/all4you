## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Backend Enhancements
```javascript

router.post('/register-with-fica', upload.fields([
  { name: 'idDocument', maxCount: 1 },
  { name: 'proofOfAddress', maxCount: 1 },
  { name: 'bankStatement', maxCount: 1 }
]), async (req, res) => {
  // Comprehensive registration logic with email notifications
});
```

### Frontend Improvements
```typescript
// Two-step registration with file upload validation
const validateStep2 = () => {
  if (!files.idDocument || !files.proofOfAddress || !files.bankStatement) {

    return false
  }
  // Additional validation logic
}
```

```typescript
// Real-time user status updates with email notifications
const updateUserStatus = async (userId: string, status: string, ficaStatus?: string) => {
  // API call with JWT authentication
  // Automatic email notification to user
  // UI refresh with success feedback
}
```
